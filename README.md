### code style guide and discipline ✨

- branch name doesn't matter, you can name your branch as you wish.If you have done your task, please make a PR(pull request) with title name "`feat:featurename`"

- please use `single quotes` for code formatting, to do that , simply add `"prettier.singleQuote": true,` in your VSCode setting.json file.

- please use `camelCase` for every declared variable.

- please make sure you use `es6 syntax`.

- `commenting` you code would be very helpful to understand other developers but don't need to comment in every single line.

- **NOTE**: I won't be merge your request if you are not cute like me.

- **Happy collaboration** 🐱‍💻
